            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>
                To objective was to create an interactive data visualisation 
                on the topic of internet health with the intention of mobilising 
                the public into taking action for positive change. This was in 
                collaboration with Mozilla and their Annual Internet Health Report.

            <h3>Approach</h3>
            <p>
                The outcome was an educational game that initially explored the porn 
                industry and its effect on society before asking the user a series of 
                questions about their experience with porn. The user's answer to these 
                questions would be displayed alongside the last 15 users to create a 
                sense of community and solidarity whilst keeping animosity. It was 
                through these UX processes that I discovered the importance of 
                anonymity in this user-centred design due to the sensitivity of the 
                topic.
            </p>

            <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <p>
                Overall, I was happy with my final outcome. I believe that it achieved 
                the objectives of creating a visualisation on the topic of internet 
                health, as the porn industry is one of the most influential and 
                mobilised actions by the user through education and reflection. If I 
                were to pursue this further, I would collect further data to help 
                address more ways in which the porn industry affects society.
