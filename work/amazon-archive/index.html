            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>
                The brief for this project was to code an archive of images that were 
                sorted into three categories but together developed a collection.

            <h3>Approach</h3>
            <p>
                When we say “Amazon”, we no longer think about the largest rainforest in 
                the world, along with the huge ecosystems within it. Instead, we think of 
                Amazon, the multinational corporation. I, therefore, wanted to shed light 
                on the Amazon rainforest and the people who call it home. I selected three 
                tribes in the Amazon Rainforest and researched their stories before creating 
                an image archive. To emphasise the importance of this story, I focused on 
                the users&apos; journey and made this as interactive yet emotive as possible. As 
                the audience was broader for this project, I was able to regularly receive 
                user feedback throughout my low and high-fidelity mock-ups through to my 
                final outcome.

            <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <p>
                I coded a responsive collection of images showing the amazon rainforest, the 
                destruction that it faces, and the effect this has on the people who live there. 
                The collection is arranged to tell the story of the importance of the amazon, 
                how it is being destroyed and then exploring the tribes that live there and how 
                they have been affected. By controlling the order of the archives, I was able 
                to take the user on an emotive narrative that focused their attention on the 
                stories.

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>
                Reflecting on this project, I was happy with the outcome. I was able to gain a 
                greater understanding of user journeys and the importance of it what the user 
                takes away from the experience. I was also able to gain experience with coding 
                in JavaScript to create a responsive archive. As this was a university project, 
                there were time contrasts; however, if I were to pursue this further, I would 
                add additional tribes to the archive to further expand the narrative.
