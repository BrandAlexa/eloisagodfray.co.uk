            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>
                As part of a collaborative University project, our aim was to find out how 
                clear/easy it is for the user to find and execute common tasks on the DB app 
                when trying to book a ticket and therefore conclude whether the app is 
                user-friendly. Usability Testing.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h3>Approach</h3>
            <p>
                We felt that the DB app was not user-friendly and wanted to test this with 
                the use of eye tracking. We believed that the best users to test this on were 
                international students who have little or no experience with the app so that 
                they have not already learnt how to navigate around the app through experience. 
                We then created personas to better understand our users and created scenarios 
                for the users to test on the app while using eye-tracking glasses. We created 
                three different scenarios to test different features of the app. We then 
                analysed the results of the eye tracking data along with a survey we created 
                to see how easy it was for the user to buy a ticket on the DB app based on the 
                scenario given to them.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <p>
                The result was that there was a recurring issue with users being unable to navigate 
                to the &lsquo;Search Options&rsquo; section on the DB app and make adjustments to their search 
                criteria. This could be seen in the data collected from the eye tracking, with, 
                for instance, one user not navigating to this till their 99th gaze. At the time, 
                users would be more motivated to search around the app for the function due to the 
                9 Euro ticket making it in their interest to navigate to the Regional Transport 
                only. The next stage would be to contact DB with these results and work together 
                on improving their UX based on these results.

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>
                This was a very interesting user research project that allowed me to gain a greater 
                understanding of the importance of UX in designing an app. This is because if the UX 
                of an app or website is poor, it will have an effect on the business&apos;s sales too. If 
                I were to pursue this further, I would consider using the data we collected, as well 
                as gathering other data, to make mock-ups that could be A/B tested.
