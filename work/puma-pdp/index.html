            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>
                The aim was to ensure there was a difference between buying a 
                regular product and a limited-edition product and therefore make 
                the experience for the customer buying these products different. 
                This would be achieved by creating an elevated PDP template that 
                can be reused for different collaborations.

            <h3>Approach</h3>
            <p>
                One main inspiration for this was from a Sanity article on &lsquo;5 Ways 
                to Make Your E-commerce Product Pages Pop&rsquo;. I first researched how 
                other companies in e-commerce have created their elevated PDPs. I 
                then conducted some UX research and looked at what other UX 
                articles suggested. Once I determined what was needed, I began to 
                make wireframes before moving to low and high-fidelity mock-ups. 
                One key UX research that led my design was from Baymard&apos;s Institute 
                which said, â€œMany participants during testing commented on how 
                important product images were to their product investigation 
                strategy. As one participant said, <em>&ldquo;I guess for me the most 
                important information is the picture.&rdquo;</em> I kept the main functions 
                of the page the same for predictability, such as add to cart and 
                sizing selector. However, I added a hero image at the start to 
                bring the page to life, as well as adding other media to the page, 
                such as videos to empathise the brand story and what else is in the 
                collaboration.

            <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <p>
                I created an elevated PDP, which makes the product feel limited edition and 
                price justifiable. This was with PUMA&apos;s Perks and Mini&apos;s collaboration, but 
                it can also work as a template and be reused for other elevated PDPs in the 
                future.
