            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>
                The brief was to create, design and implement a rule-based system that generates 
                a series of images based on rules and themes of our choosing. I decided to base my 
                drawing system around the concept of lockdown and the political, social and 
                emotional impact that it has had on our lives. I wanted to create a reflective 
                exercise that allowed the user to take a moment and look back whilst still 
                creating a positive outcome through a piece of artwork.

            <h3>Approach</h3>
            <p>
                I created a list of design principles that I needed to use to guide my design 
                process. With this in mind, I then created a series of â€¦ questions. I chose this 
                format of questions to allow the user a greater range and, in turn, create a more 
                diverse piece of artwork. Once I created a list of questions, I coded a piece of 
                artwork that would be responsive to the users&apos; answers. I user-tested this on 
                anonymous users to ensure that they did not feel pressured or judged when answering 
                and asked them to provide some written feedback.
            </p>

            <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <p>
                The final outcome was a range of responsive artwork in response to the political, 
                social and emotional impact the lockdown had on our lives with the use of P5.js. 
                Although this was a small project, I was curious how this drawing system would be 
                used by other users, so I carried out a few more user testing. I was intrigued to 
                see the differences or correlations between users from different ages and 
                social-economic backgrounds and how that could be represented in a piece of art. 
                I am proud of this project as I used a small brief to learn and develop my coding 
                skills using a new JS library.
