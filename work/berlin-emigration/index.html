            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>
                The aim of this research project was to produce two static visualisations within 
                a set timeframe; they could work together or be contrasting views. I wanted to 
                produce two data visualisations that provoked reflection on a more personal 
                human-to-human level rather than just cold numbers. I was inspired by history and 
                its importance of it. I thought that Berlin would be highly suited to the project 
                because the two visualisations would be the same but different, similar to East and 
                West Berlin. One city divided. I, therefore, aimed to create two visualisations 
                that represented this divide.

            <h3>Approach</h3>
            <p>
                I began this process by collecting inspirational data visualisation as well as 
                researching East and West Berlin to get a general overview. Two pieces of visual 
                inspiration that particularly stood out to me were Stasi Files as well as â€¦. Work. 
                I, therefore, researched and collected data about individuals&apos; experiences and 
                created a report of their lives. To create a balanced perspective, I chose a range 
                of individuals to show that not everyone disliked or had the same experience 
                living in East Berlin.

            <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <p>
                The outcome of this project was two static visualisations. The first used a mural 
                from the Berlin wall to explain that the Berlin Wall, along with its fall, came 
                with mixed feelings. The second visualisation represents individuals&apos; stories of 
                their experience of living in a divided Berlin during 1960 &ndash; 2000. These 
                visualisations created a meaningful response from my peers and teachers, 
                highlighting the importance of history.
