            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>
                The intention of this project was to create a homepage for a community. It could 
                be for a community that I was involved with, admired or a fictional community. I 
                decided that I wanted to choose a community in which I could be creative and 
                playful when designing. I, therefore, chose retro video game enthusiasts as my 
                community. Although I did not grow up with most of these games, it was interesting 
                to see the graphics and user interface in these games, which many reminisce about. 
                I, therefore, created a homepage that worked as a memorial for retro video game 
                enthusiasts.

            <h3>Approach</h3>
            <p>
                I began the process by first researching popular retro video games and defining a 
                time period in history to focus on. I then sought inspiration from the video games 
                themselves and their graphic designs. Next, I created a user journey and refined 
                what essential functions were as well as UI elements. I created wireframes and a 
                range of fidelity mock-ups before user testing and finally coding the website.

            <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <p>
                The outcome of this project was a homepage that displayed retro video games in a 
                memorial display similar to a museum. Through this website, the user would be able 
                to learn more about the games, find out where they can play them and how to link up 
                with others also interested in retro video games. This project received positive 
                responses due to its playful nature with GIFs, animations and sound effects, which 
                are not standard in web pages.

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>
                Through this project, I was able to be experimental due to the objective; this 
                allowed me to add small features such as sound on hovering over buttons. I enjoyed 
                the experimentalist nature of this project, and if I was to pursue it further, I 
                would like to user test on more people within this community as well as interview 
                them, as I was not able to do this due to time and practical limitations.
