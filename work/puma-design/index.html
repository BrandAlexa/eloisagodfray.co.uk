            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>
                The objective was to create a visualisation that would show the impact the 
                creation of the design system has had on PUMA as a company since it first 
                started just over a year ago. The audience is employees from all over the 
                organisation, not just within design or tech.

            <h3>Approach</h3>
            <p>
                I first began with collecting data from the data that Figma provides, as 
                well as talking to colleagues who work with the design system to see how 
                it has impacted them. I also conducted some data scrapping from the Figma 
                documentation as well as the developer&apos;s side. Once I had a range of data, 
                I began to construct a story and ranked what data empathised this story as 
                well as considering the user journey. I then began an iterative process of 
                creating several options and mock-ups of visuals that I then received 
                feedback on and refined before constructing one visualisation.

            <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <p>
                The outcome was a visualisation of PUMA&apos;s Design System that was 
                designed for an audience who had little or no knowledge of design systems. 
                I, therefore, made simplified explained visuals and used motifs that were 
                relatable to employees working in a sports e-commerce business.
